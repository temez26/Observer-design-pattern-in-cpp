# Observer Pattern Example

This C++ code demonstrates an example of the Observer design pattern. The `Observer` class defines an interface for objects that should be notified of changes in a `Subject`. The `Subject` class maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any changes. In this example, the `EventDetectorSystem` class extends the `Subject` class and simulates the detection of an event. The `ConcreteObserver` class extends the `Observer` class and implements the `update()` method to receive notifications.

To use this code, compile and run it. The program will simulate the detection of events and notify the registered observers.
